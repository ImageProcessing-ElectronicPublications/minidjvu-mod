USUAL INSTALLATION
__________________

Should work as usual:

    ./configure
    make

Libtool executable wrapper `bin/minidjvu' should appear. Now,

    make install

will install the executable, the library and the man page.
Installing headers is not yet supported (they are too unstable).



CUSTOM COMPILATION
__________________

If you want to compile it all manually, read this.

The release directory should be treated as an include directory
(usually -I or /I option). That applies both to the library and the program.

The library is built from sources in `minidjvu' subdirectory.
The program is built from sources in `src' subdirectory.

To enable TIFF support, define HAVE_TIFF to 1, then link against libtiff.
Don't forget to add libtiff include directory to the include search path.

Libtiff for Windows may be found here:

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm

Funnily, libtiff with its zlib and jpeg coders is much bigger than minidjvu.



STATIC COMPILATION
__________________

Under Linux, you can always try something like

    g++ -I. `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -o bin/minidjvu
    
or, if you want TIFF support,

    g++ -DHAVE_TIFF=1 -I. `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -ltiff -o bin/minidjvu

To compile it statically under Windows, you have to disable
__declspec directives in `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h'.



COMPILING ON MAC
________________

/* This instructions were kindly sent to me by Alejandro David Weil.
 * Apparently, there are some problems with Macs, but I don't know why.
 */

After some tries I got minidjvu built and running on mac os X panther.
I had to make this:

1. setup:
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3

2. run configure in this way:
LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib" ./configure

3.before compile, modify file libtool changing the allow_undefined_flag to:
allow_undefined_flag="-undefined dynamic_lookup"

4. now run:
make 



PORTING
_______

Browse through `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h' to see if it needs changing.
What next, I don't know :)

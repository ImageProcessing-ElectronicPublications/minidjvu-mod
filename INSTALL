USUAL INSTALLATION
__________________

Should work as usual:

    ./configure
    make

The executable (`minidjvu') should appear in src/ subdirectory.

    make install

That will install the executable, the library and the man page.
Installing headers is not yet supported (they are too unstable).



CUSTOM COMPILATION
__________________

If you want to compile it all manually, read this.

The release directory should be treated as an include directory
(usually -I or /I option). That applies both to the library and the program.

The library is built from sources in `minidjvu' subdirectory.
The program is built from sources in `src' subdirectory.

To enable TIFF support, define HAVE_TIFF to 1, then link against libtiff.
Don't forget to add libtiff include directory to the include search path.

Libtiff for Windows may be found here:

    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm

Funnily, libtiff with its zlib and jpeg coders is much bigger than minidjvu.



STATIC COMPILATION
__________________

Under Linux, you can always try something like

    g++ -I. `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -o src/minidjvu
    
or, if you want TIFF support,

    g++ -DHAVE_TIFF=1 -I. `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -ltiff -o src/minidjvu

To compile it statically under Windows, you have to disable
__declspec directives in `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h'.



PORTING
_______

Browse through `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h' to see if it needs changing.
What next, I don't know :)

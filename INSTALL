USUAL INSTALLATION

Should work as usual:

    ./configure
    make
    make install


CUSTOM COMPILATION
__________________

If you want to compile it all manually, read this.

The release directory should be treated as an include directory
(usually -I or /I option). That applies both to the library and the program.

The library is built from sources in `minidjvu' subdirectory.
The program is built from sources in `src' subdirectory.

To compile a static library under Windows, you have to disable
__declspec directives in `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h'.

If you want to compile it under some strange platform (like DOS),
browse through `minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h' to see what
changes should be made.

minidjvu is an encoder/decoder of black-and-white DjVu pages.
There's also a multipage encoder.


Besides DjVu, minidjvu understands PBM, Windows BMP and TIFF (through libtiff).


When applied in lossy mode to an existing DjVu file, minidjvu can usually
shrink it by about 5-10% of its size. That, of course, does not apply to files
created by minidjvu itself. So, minidjvu can nicely complement some commercial
encoders (single-page only yet, alas).


minidjvu is derived from DjVuLibre, the primary DjVu support library.

This is `minidjvu' (version 0.1), a library that supports
decompression of single-page black-and-white DjVu files.

Under Windows, it compiles into a DLL (unlike DjVuLibre).
I hope that will make adding minimal DjVu support into programs easier.

It also comes with an example program, named also `minidjvu',
which decompresses DjVu into PBM or Windows BMP from the command line.


This is a very early release. The library interface is _unstable_.

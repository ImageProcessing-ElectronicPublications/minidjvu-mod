This is minidjvu, version 0.2.


It's a library that supports decompression and lossless compression 
of black-and-white DjVu pages.

Under Windows, it compiles into a DLL (unlike DjVuLibre).
I hope that will make adding minimal DjVu support into programs easier.

It also comes with an example command-line program, named also `minidjvu',
which can compress and decompress DjVu files and "smooth" bitmaps (use -s).
Bitmaps can be read/written in PBM and Windows BMP formats.


This is an early release. The library interface is _unstable_.

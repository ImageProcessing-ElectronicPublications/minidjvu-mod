minidjvu is an encoder/decoder of black-and-white DjVu pages.



It supports lossy and lossless compression modes and, of course, decompression.

Besides DjVu, minidjvu understands PBM, Windows BMP and TIFF (through libtiff).

When applied in lossy mode to an existing DjVu file, minidjvu can usually
shrink it by about 5-10% of its size. That, of course, does not apply to files
created by minidjvu itself. So, minidjvu can nicely complement some commercial
encoders (single-page only yet, alas).


minidjvu is also a library that supports all the functionality.
Under Windows, the library compiles into a DLL (unlike DjVuLibre).
I hope this will make adding DjVu support into programs easier.

This is yet an early release. The library interface is _unstable_.


minidjvu is derived from DjVuLibre, the primary DjVu support library.

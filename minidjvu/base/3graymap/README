There's no special graymap type in minidjvu, and adding it is not planned.
So, graymaps are stored in three variables: unsigned char **, int32 and int32
(data, width and height).

Overall, graymap support is poor: there is only create/destroy functions.
Since no algorithms in minidjvu use graymaps yet, there's no need to have more.

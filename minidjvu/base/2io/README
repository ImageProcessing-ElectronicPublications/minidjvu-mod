Under Windows there is no libc. So it may well occur that minidjvu uses one
stdio implementation, and an application linked against minidjvu uses another.
In that case we can't exchange (FILE *) pointers reliably. So here is a simple
stdio wrapper to allow applications invoke our stdio.

Also added some integer read/write functions.
